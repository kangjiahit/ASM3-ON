This repository contains some ASM3-ON codes I've writing during the application of the ASM3 model.

Some points to consider when checking this repository out:

1- The codes for sensitivity analysis are written in R language, and the codes for iterative method are written in matlab program.

2- In the process of checking the iterative method, run the "iterative method" file instead of the “f” file. You can change the number of data points of each value in the "iterative method" file during the verification process.

If you have any questions about the ASM3-ON language, I am happy to help you answer these questions.
